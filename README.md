### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Senior Software Development Engineer with deep expertise in full-stack development, specializing in React, Node.js, Go, TypeScript, and GraphQL. I bring a proven track record of success across enterprise, e-commerce, banking, and startup environments, consistently delivering scalable and high-quality solutions.

With experience mentoring and leading teams, I excel at driving technical initiatives and fostering collaboration. In my most recent role, I spearheaded the transition to microservices and improved system performance through serverless architectures. Having worked with prominent companies in the US, I am open to international opportunities where I can apply my skills to build innovative, impactful solutions.

Now seeking new challenges, I am eager to leverage my expertise to help organizations scale, modernize, and innovate in fast-paced, technology-driven environments.

I am commercetools JavaScript developer Certified.

Now I am currently working in helping companies to  modernize their e-commerce(Headless, Microservices  based, API-first, and Cloud-native SaaS) using set of new tools.
